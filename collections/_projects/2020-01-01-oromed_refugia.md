![Project visual summary]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.header.teaser }})

OroMed-Refugia will carry out a multidisciplinary integration of paleoecological data (pollen fossil records, macroremains and dendrocronological data), vegetation modelling and biogeographical and evolutionary studies, through the analyses of both previous fossil records and new sequences and surveys (last ~26.500 years) from Southern Iberia and North Africa. The project focuses on five conifer trees spread across Western Mediterranean mountains (Southern Spain and Morocco), Abies pinsapo Boiss., A. marocana Trabut, A. tazaotana Côzar ex Huguet del Villar, Cedrus atlantica (Endl.) Manetti ex Carriere and Pinus nigra Arnold. OroMed-Refugia will assess the past dynamics of these conifer forests during the last millennia to understand the drivers of their resilience throughout the present interglacial period.
A powerful reason for increasing conservation measures is that high-mountain communities provide valuable ecosystem services and contribute to the welfare of societies in the South of the Iberian Peninsula and the North of Africa.
